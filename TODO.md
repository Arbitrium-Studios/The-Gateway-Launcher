### Wishlist and Ideas for the T.U.G. Launcher:

    > Using whatever version of PLAYER ZER0 STUDIOS you download The Gateway from (i.e. from the English, Spanish, French, etc. versions of the website), the installer should be based on that same language it autoselected from
    > When you open the installer, it should give you a choice of what language to choose, from that it should default to which language you set it in.
    > Add an accounts system
        > Link said account system to all future games including Toontown Fantasy.
    > Prior to the log in screen, it should show credits for who made it like LEGO Games do
        > After that, it should have one of those screens asking you to press any button to continue.
            > This area should show portals leading to certain areas and people walking through them to get where they want to go using randomly generated models.
        > When you press a button, it should check if you're playing on a Controller, Touch Screen, or Keyboard
    > When installing, it should install the phase_1 folder which contains the launcher assets and whatever's necessary to launch the launcher.
    > When opening the application, it should immediately open a window where you can log in similar to the scrapped 2003 Toontown Online log in screen
        > Instead of launching into Toontown, it should launch you into a 2d version of The Trans-Universal Gateway (TUG)
    > If it cannot connect to the server, it should ask to try again or try connecting locally
        > This should make The Gateway and all the games playable even if PLAYER ZER0 STUDIOS goes under as it will give you the option to search for compiled directories to launch the game from.
    > When you've logged in, the camera should pan from where it was to the front of one of the portals.
        > Said portal should be the game with the most recent update or release.
        > After that, the game's logo should fade onto screen.
        > There should be a short description of the game
        > There should be arrow buttons that move between portals showcasing each game.
        > When you log out and relogin after you played a game, it should default to the most recently played game
        > Unless you select a button that selects where you'd like to start from.
        > There should be a notification box in different areas
            > This should be sorted by server announcements and each game should have their own box!
    > More soon!
