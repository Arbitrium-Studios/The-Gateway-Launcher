# The-Gateway

 The Gateway is a social hangout where you can create an avatar and connect with friends OR you can go through various gateways to play through stories within  The Lovelight Saga's canon without needing to watch the animations at all.

 The plan is to release The Gateway onto Steam for free with 1 full world to play through before you make the decision to buy more worlds through cheap DLC. I'd like to think of it like Genshin Impact but with more content and anybody can play it regardless of what PC you have! Also, I plan to add texture pack and modding capabilities! But right now, it's just an idea!

 The ideal engine to run The Gateway in is Unreal Engine 4 and to write The Gateway in Python!
